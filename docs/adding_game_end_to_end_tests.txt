def test_level9(self):
    self.run_level_test(9)
Copy the test method and change the level number
Go to ocargo/game/end_to_end_tests/data/blockly_solutions and create a new solution file there according to the naming convention: level_{number}.xml.
Go to the game screen and solve the level getting maximum score.
Run this in developer's console in the browser to print the workspace xml:

Blockly.Xml.workspaceToDom(Blockly.mainWorkspace);

Copy the workspace xml / solution to the level_{number}.xml file.
Run the test and see it passing.
