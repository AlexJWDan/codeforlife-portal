Process to be followed with each release to keep everyone in the team in the loop

1. Code review with another member of the team
2. Commit and push to relevant directory. This will kick off the Jenkins processes here:
 https://build.codeforlife.education
3. Supposing the tests all pass the commit will be deployed to Dev. This can be accessed from the Google App Engine
 Portal via Compute>Versions>'dev' from the drop down menu here:
 https://console.developers.google.com/project/decent-digit-629
4. Manually test in Dev to double check any issues
5. Once happy, run 'Deploy to Prod' build in Jenkins using the build number from the correct 'Deploy to Dev' build.
6. Once this completes switch to prod by choosing 'default' from the dropdown menu on the Google App Engine
'Versions' screen, ticking the box next to the new prod version and clicking 'Make default'.
7. Close the issue on git hub and change the position of the corresponding post-it on the Canban board.
8. Send an email to the Code for Life community to update everyone of the changes: coding-for-life-dev-xd@ocado.com.
Refer to the git hub issue number in this email to make it easy for the team to understand what has changed.
